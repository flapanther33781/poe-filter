This is a checklist of all the statically-assigned items in the filter. MF players will want to adjust these depending on what you're farming, but everything falls into one of three categories: delete the section completely, safe to ignore, or can be adjusted by tool settings.

Statically assigned GREEN items:
2x2 and 1x3 items that exceed the Rare ilvl slider setting - set the slider to 100
Rare Rings/Amulet/Belts/Jewels that exceed the Rare ilvl slider setting - set the slider to 100
Only if checkbox is selected: Normal & Magic 5L, or Rares below the Rare ilvl slider - don't check the checkbox
Magic Divine/Eternal Life/Mana flasks - manually delete
Normal/Magic Utility Flasks - manually delete
