#===============================================================================================================
##### INSTALLATION / UPDATE :
##### 
##### If you have Python installed on your PC you can download the code for the scripts, run it on your own PC,
##### and create filters with up-to-date pricing whenever you want!  Just download the zip file from the Github
##### page linked above, and double-click the file titled "00-super-simple-loot-filter.py".
##### 
##### If you don't want to run the files yourself you can download the text-based filters from my Github page linked above.
##### Check for updates once a month or at least before new leagues to get the latest update.
##### 
##### Once you have the filter file, put it into the following folder: %userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile
#####    (If you're not sure where your folder is, in the game, go to Options -> Game -> and click the folder icon.)
##### Then, in the game, go to Options -> Game -> and select the filter from the Dropdown box.
#===============================================================================================================
##### Thank you to StupidFatHobbit and the guys over at FilterBlade, you all taught me a lot. This filter
##### isn't meant to replace theirs. This filter is for new players who aren't ready for racing, crafting,
##### hardcore, SSF, or build-specific highlighting - seriously, just THE MOST BASIC filter possible.
##### 
##### Due to not showing those items this filter will be more strict than theirs, and does NOT use combinations of
##### background color, text color, or border color when displaying an item.  This filter displays ALL items with
##### black text, a white border for items that take up 1-2 inventory slots, a red border if it takes 3-4 slots,
##### and the background color is based on softcore market prices obtained from poe.ninja.
##### 
##### (Yes, experienced players know poe.ninja's pricing isn't perfect, but for a completely new player it's good
##### enough to start with. Anyway, this tool also allows you to do manual overrides.)
##### 
##### The second goal for this filter is to configure tiers universally, across all item types.  If you see
##### a color you know what its value is, regardless of what kind of item it is. No need to memorize multiple
##### tier profiles, nor combinations of background and border colors.
#===============================================================================================================
##### Color order: Brown > Red > Orange > Yellow > Green > Blue > Purple > Cyan > Pink > White
##### 
##### Unique items that share a common base will be gray.
##### 
##### Minimap Icons:
##### Diamond ---- All T1 drops
##### Hexagon ---- Currency, Splinters
##### Pentagon --- League Items, Maps, Scarabs
##### Star ------- T2 & T3 Uniques
##### Cross ------ All other Uniques
##### Kite ------- Veiled, Enchanted, Synthesized, Fractured, Influenced items
##### Square ----- Prophecies, Cards, Oils, Essences, Fossils, Incubators, etc.
##### Triangle --- Rare Gear, Rare Jewels
##### Circle ----- Gems, Flasks
##### Rain ------- Use this for user overrides (crafting, recepies, etc)
##### 
##### Aside from Diamond and Rain, more sides = more important, but color's still more important than the icon.
##### An item with a Green Circle is worth more than one with a Red Pentagon. Colors follow the rainbow, but brown
##### is below, and Cyan, Pink, and White above.
#===============================================================================================================
##### The tool I created to generate these filters does have a few other abilities, please check out my Github
##### page for more info (linked above). If there's something you'd like to see added please message me there.
#===============================================================================================================
##### Note: This tool includes a function to preserve your manually-set overrides, but (a) it only works
##### if the lines it's looking for don't change drastically, and (b) right now this tool is an an ALPHA
##### stage, so it may change without notice, which may overwrite your manual overrides. As this
##### progresses towards a BETA release this should stabilize, but for now please understand this is what
##### needs to happen to get the tool to where it needs to be.
##### 
##### Also, because it's in an ALPHA stage, the tool's actually creating a much longer filter file than
##### it may need to. It was impossible to tell how long the text output was going to be until I built the
##### tool, but now that I understand the output I'll be looking for ways to summarize and scale back the
##### length of the filter. But even if I don't, even as it is now this filter isn't substantially longer
##### than either FilterBlade's or StupidFatHobbit's.

##### Normal/magic are only worth grabbing in Acts 1-5 when you need the
